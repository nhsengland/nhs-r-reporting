    "text": "What is R and why is it used at NHSE?\nR is an open-source programming language that is widely used among statisticians and data scientists in the NHS. R has a large number of built-in functions and packages for statistical analysis and data visualisation. Along with tools such as Python1, R can be used to develop so-called reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP).\nReproducible analytical pipelines are the gold standard for creating analytical outputs in government2. It is a set of standards that promote best practice across the sector3. By following RAP we can be much more transparent with how we work, increasing trust and confidence in our publications, and make it easier for others to verify and replicate our analysis."

This is an example of a quarto website with an NHS Theme — it is a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.\nQuarto integrates with R, Python or HTML, CSS so you can make your websites as complex and beautiful as you like as you see examples and reuse and remix from others in the open community.\n\nWhat is Quarto?\nQuarto helps you have your ideas and your code in one place, and present it in a beautiful way.\nQuarto unifies and extends the RMarkdown ecosystem - it unifies by combining the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringian, etc into a single consistent system. And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more “guardrails”: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love R-Markdown, and it’s for people who have never used RMarkdown.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!\n\n\nExample Quarto sites\nA few Quarto websites from Openscapes - so far we have been using Quarto for documentation using Quarto and Markdown files and Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nChampions Lessons Series\nOpenscapes Approach Guide\n\n2021 NASA Cloud Hackathon\nFaylab Lab Manual\nA Quarto tip a day, by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel"

    "text": "Link to the Git in R-Studio tutorial\nAttention all R-Studio users! We are excited to announce a new tutorial created by Pablo Leon-Rodenas. This guide will take you through the process of creating new R-Studio projects with version control features using Git and GitHub, and linking R-Studio with a GitHub repository.\nBy following this tutorial, you will be able to work entirely from R-Studio, applying version control to your scripts, creating new projects on GitHub, and doing all standard version control actions such as commits, pushes, and merges directly from R-Studio. This will make it easy for you to keep track of changes made to your projects and collaborate with others.\nPablo Leon-Rodenas is a Data analyst working in the NHS England and has created this tutorial to help R-Studio users take advantage of the powerful features offered by Git and GitHub. If you have any questions or need further assistance, you can reach out to Pablo at <pablo.leonrodenas@nhs.net>.\nDon’t miss out on this valuable resource, check out the tutorial today and start taking control of your R-Studio projects today!"
