This is an example of a quarto website with an NHS Theme — it is a really powerful way to create and share your work. You can communicate about science using the same reproducible workflow you and/or your colleagues use for analyses, whether or not you write code.\nQuarto integrates with R, Python or HTML, CSS so you can make your websites as complex and beautiful as you like as you see examples and reuse and remix from others in the open community."

And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more “guardrails”: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love R-Markdown, and it’s for people who have never used RMarkdown.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!"
