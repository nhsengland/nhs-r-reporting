## Intro {background="#43464B"}

These slides were presented in the NHSE-R drop in session on Friday 26th May 2023.

In R we can plot geospatial data using several methods, today I will focus on static maps using `ggplot2` and `osm` packages. Drawing maps usually imply these steps:

-   Getting shapefiles to draw a map
-   Obtaining metadata to plot on the map 
-   In R we load the multypoligon objects using `geom_sf()` and `coord_sf()`
-   Then we can take advantage of ggplot2 framework to overlay one map on top of another

An introduction to plotting maps in R using ggplot2 can be found on this online book: <https://ggplot2-book.org/maps.html>.



## 1. NHS Health boundaries{auto-animate="true" background="#43464B"}

The Office for National Statistics provides a free and open access to several geographic products. There is a specific section for `Health boundaries` on their `Open Geography Portal` website: <https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>. 

From `Clinical Commissioning Groups` section download  `2021 Boundaries` **shapefile** zipped file.
