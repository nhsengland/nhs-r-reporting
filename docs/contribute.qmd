## How to contribute?

### Make a new branch of the repository

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Make a new `.qmd` (q-markdown) file in the `/docs` folder

To the `.qmd` file add a YAML header with a title and subtitle.
```yaml
---
title: Contribute to the docs
subtitle: "How to add a new page to the documentations site using Quarto?"
---
```

### Add a link to your file to the `_quarto.yml` config file in `/docs`

Open the `_quarto.yml` configuration file and find the `sidebar` config code.
```yaml
sidebar:
  - id: nav
    style: "floating"
    collapse-level: 3
    align: left
    contents:
```
Under the `contents:` object add a new section (if required), a string lable for your page, and a link to the `.qmd` file itself.

```yaml
- section: "RAP"
  contents:
    - text: "Reproducible Analytical Pipelines"
      file: intro-to-rap.qmd
```
